> Welcome to exTHmUI Android source repositories

> Now I'm the [only person](https://github.com/Yuyuko1024) in the organization doing ~~very slow~~ development.  And now I only have Mediatek device for ROM development, so I urgently need someone to adapt Qualcomm SoC devices. The support of Qualcomm SoC in this project is not perfect at present, and there are still many problems. If you are willing, please submit the Pull Request to the project repository for review. After the review, it will be merged.

### About ``exTHmUI`` ###
This is a minor modification based on [AOSP](http://android.googlesource.com/), a third-party Android system, under the condition of keeping the original Android style appropriate to add some simple easy to use domestic localization features.

### About ``exTHmUI`` ###
This is a minor modification based on [AOSP](http://android.googlesource.com/), a third-party Android system, under the condition of keeping the original Android style appropriate to add some simple easy to use domestic localization features.

### Android 14 source pre-release is available now!
Now you can get the Android 14 QPR 1 ```codename Utsuho``` source at [here](https://github.com/exthmui-next), and now is support Qualcomm device build!
